\subsection*{Problem 1}
\subsubsection*{Part a}
First we show that $A = \{ \mathbf{a}^m \mathbf{b}^n \mathbf{c}^n | m,n \ge 0 \}$ is context free. The grammar is as follows:
\begin{align*}
S \rightarrow & XY \\
X \rightarrow & \varepsilon \; | \; aX \\
Y \rightarrow & \varepsilon \; | \; bYc \\
\end{align*}
Clearly this generates only strings in the language, and every string in $A$ can be mapped to this by the number of generations of $X$ and $Y$ corresponding to $m$ and $n$ respectively. The language $B = \{ \mathbf{a}^n \mathbf{b}^n \mathbf{c}^m | m,n \ge 0 \}$ is almost identical:
\begin{align*}
S \rightarrow & XY \\
X \rightarrow & \varepsilon \; | \; aXb \\
Y \rightarrow & \varepsilon \; | \; cY \\
\end{align*}
With the proof that for this being the same as $A$. So these two languages are context free, however their intersection $C = A \cap B = \{ \mathbf{a}^n \mathbf{b}^n \mathbf{c}^n | n \ge 0 \}$ is not context free, as we showed in class.

\subsubsection*{Part b}
We show that the complement of a context free language is not necessarily context free. Suppose not, i.e. that CFLs are closed under complementation. Now, for any context free languages $A$ and $B$, $A \cup B$ would be context free, since context free languages are closed under union. Then $\bar{A \cup B} = \bar{A} \cap \bar{B}$ would also be in the language. Since we assume that context free languages are closed under complement $\bar{A}$ and $\bar{B}$ would be context free. But since $A$ and $B$ are arbitrary that means the intersection of any two context free languages is context free, a contradiction (proved false in part A above). Therefore context free languages are not closed under complement.

\section*{Problem 2}
The context free grammar $G$ of $L = \{ w\#x | w^\mathcal{R} \textrm{is a substring of }x, x \in \{0,1\}^* \}$ is:
\begin{align*}
S \rightarrow & aSXaX \; | \; bSXbX \; | \; \# \\
X \rightarrow & \varepsilon \; | \; aX \; | \; bX \\
\end{align*}
Now we need prove this is correct, or in other words $L(G) \subseteq L$ and $L \subseteq L(G)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $L(G) \subseteq L$. This generates strings of the form
      $\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \ldots \sigma_n \# \{a,b\}^* \sigma_n \{a,b\}^* \sigma_{n-1} \ldots \{a,b\}^* \sigma_1 \{a,b\}^* = w\#x$.
      Each generation of $S$ creates some $\sigma_i$ on the left and right, with the right having the reverse order of the left.
      The variable $X$ can generate any string in $\{a,b\}^*$, which generates the strings between the characters on the left side.
      So by construction $w^\mathcal{R}$ is a substring of $x$ as every $\sigma_i$ in $w$ is in $x$ and in the same order. Therefore
      the language this grammar generates is a subset of $L$
\item $L \subseteq L(G)$. Again the grammar generates strings of the form 
      $\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \ldots \sigma_n \# \{a,b\}^* \sigma_n \{a,b\}^* \sigma_{n-1} \ldots \{a,b\}^* \sigma_1 \{a,b\}^* = w\#x$.
      By definition if $x$ is a substring of $y$ then there exists $z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n, z_{n+1} \in \{a,b\}^*$ such that 
      $y = z_1 x_1 \ldots z_n x_n z_{n+1}$. So for every string $s = w\#x \in L$ map $w_1$ to $\sigma_n$, and in general $w_i$ to
      $\sigma_{n-i+1}$ and then the $z_i$ map to the $\{a,b\}^*$. 
\end{itemize}

% I am not sure how good this proof is, Dagaen. If you can make it better please do so!

\subsection*{Problem 3}
Show that adding the rule \(S \rightarrow SS\) fails to show that context free languages are closed under Kleene star.

This fails because it is possible that the original grammar did not have $S$ able to go to a start symbol. For instance
the language \(L = \{ a^n b \mid n > 0 \}\) can be generated by the following grammar:
\[ S \rightarrow \; aS \; | \; ab \]
Adding the rule $SS$ makes this:
\[ S \rightarrow \; aS \; | \; ab \; | \; SS \]
Which is the language \(L' = \{ x^m \mid x \in L, m > 0 \}\) whereas \(L^* = L' \cup \{\varepsilon\}\). 

\subsection*{Problem 4}
Changing the grammar to new add new start symbol $S'$ and add to the production rules:
\[ S' \rightarrow \; SS' \; | \; \varepsilon \]

This makes an arbitrary number of strings in the language concatenated, including 0.

\subsection*{Problem 5}
Find a context free grammar for the language \(L = \{ x | \textrm{\#a's is 2 times \#b's}\}\)
\begin{align*}
S \rightarrow & aSbSa \;|\; bSaSa \;|\; aSaSb \;|\; SS \;|\; \varepsilon
\end{align*}

% Argument similar to the one in class about the equal number of a's and b's

\subsection*{Problem 6}
Show that \(L = \{ xy \mid x,y \in \{0,1\}^* |x| = |y|, x \neq y \}\) is context free

The following grammar generates the language
\begin{align*}
S \rightarrow & S_0 S_1 | S_1 S_0 | \varepsilon \\
S_0 \rightarrow & B S_0 B | 0 \\
S_1 \rightarrow & B S_1 B | 1 \\
B \rightarrow & 0 | 1
\end{align*}

Proof:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(L(G) \subseteq L\). 
\item \(L \subseteq L(G)\). 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Problem 7}
% Implements the above grammar, so pretty straightforward. Needs an S_0 and S_1 state basically

\subsection*{Problem 8}
Show that the language \(L = \{a^i b^j \mid i \neq j, 2i \neq j\}\) is context free.

% I am not sure this line of thinking will work... I can't figure it out
Consider 3 cases (not including the cases where $i=0$ or $j=0$)
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(j < i\)
\[ S \rightarrow aSb | aS | a \]

\item \(i < j < 2i\)
\[ S \rightarrow  S \] % Stuff goes here.

\item \(2i < j\)
\[ S \rightarrow aSbb | Sb | b \]

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 9}
\subsubsection*{Part a}
Prove \(L = \{0^n 1^n 0^n 1^n \mid n \ge 0\}\) is not context free.

Proof: Suppose not. Let $p$ be the pumping lemma constant. Consider the string $s = 0^p 1^p 0^p 1^p$. By the pumping lemma
we have $s = uvxyz$ with $|vxy| \le p$ and $|vy| > 0$, and that \(\forall i \ge 0,\; uv^ixy^iz \in L\). By the first property
we know $vxy$ cannot contain more than two symbols. If you let $i=2$ you have for any possible $s' = uv^2xy^2z$ that we have
an uneven number of 0s and 1s in the section $v^2xy^2$ than in the sections it is not in. This means $s' \notin L$.
But by the pumping lemma $s' \in L$, a contradiction. Therefore $L$ is not context free.

\subsubsection*{Part d}
Prove \(L = \{t_1\#t_2\#\ldots\#t_k \mid k \ge 2, t_i \in \{0,1\}^* \textrm{ and } \exists i, j : i \neq j \land t_i = t_j \}\) is not context free.

% OK actually the example I came up with won't work because you can have an arbitrary number of #'s and 
% I don't see how you can rule out the possibility that v or y contain the # and repeat it with two
% strings that happen to be the same...
Proof: Suppose not. Let $p$ be the pumping lemma constant. Consider the string $s = 0^p1^p \# 0^p1^p$. By the pumping lemma we have $s = uvxyz$ with $|vxy| \le p$ and $|vy| > 0$, and that \(\forall i \ge 0,\; uv^ixy^iz \in L\). We consider two cases. First, if $vxy$ does not contain the \#, then it lies entirely on one side. We can pump once to change the string on this side, therefore making it not equivalent to the other side. In this case the new string $uv^2xy^2z \notin L$. In the other case, assume $vxy$ does contain the \#. There are two subcases. First, if the \# is in $x$, then $u$ consists of only 1's and $y$ consists of only 0's. So we can pump once and the two sides are unequal, so $uv^2xy^2z \notin L$. If either $u$ or $y$ contain the \#, we can pump down to 0 and remove it, thereby getting a string with no \# that cannot be in the language. We have now covered all cases and subcases, and arrived at strings not in L using the pumping lemma. Hence, L is not context free.


\subsection*{Problem 10}
If a CFG has $b$ symbols show that if there exists a string in the language that has a derivation of size greater than $2^b$ that
the language is infinite. Assume that the CFG is in Chomsky normal form.

Proof: Each step in a derivation represents a split in the parse tree. Therefore the derivation with at least $2^b + 1$ steps
represents a parse tree with $2^b + 1$ steps. Therefore the height of this parse tree is $b+1$, since we are in Chomsky normal
form, where each node has at most branching factor 2. And by the pigeonhole principle
we have a repeated symbol on the path from the root start symbol to the furthest leaf node or terminal. Therefore like we did
in the pumping lemma, we can repeat that symbol as many times as we wish to generate a new string in the language. Therefore we
have a infinite language.
