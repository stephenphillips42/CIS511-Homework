\subsection*{Problem 1}
Show that $STRONGLY-CONNECTED = \{ \langle G \rangle \mid G \textrm{ is a graph that is strongly connected} \}$
is $NL$-complete

% Is this right?
Since $NL = $ co-$NL$, and we know that $\overline{STRONGLY-CONNECTED}$ is in $NL$, then $STRONGLY-CONNECTED$ is in
co-$NL$, hence $NL$. 

\subsection*{Problem 2}
Show that $2SAT$ is $NL$-complete.

\subsection*{Problem 3}
Give an example of an $NL$-complete context free language.

\subsection*{Problem 4}
Define $pad : \Sigma^* \times \mathcal{N} \rightarrow \Sigma^*\#^*$ as $pad(s,l) = s\#^l$. Define
the language $pad(A,f)$ for language $A$ and function $f : \mathcal{N} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}$ as
\[ pad(A,f) = \{ pad(s,f(|s|)) \mid s \in A \} \]
Show that if $A \in \textrm{TIME}(n^6)$ then $pad(A,n^2) \in \textrm{TIME}(n^3)$

Is this not just that padding extends the length of the string? Now if you run the TM for $A$ on the 
first part of the string, it will run in time $O(|s|^6)$, and since the length of our input is
$n = |s|^2 + |s| = O(|s|^2)$ this becomes $O(|s|^6) = O((|s|^2)^3) = O(n^3)$ (?)

\subsection*{Problem 5}
Prove using $pad$ from previous problem that if $NEXPTIME \neq EXPTIME$ then $P \neq NP$. 

\subsection*{Problem 6}
Show that for an $n$ variable polynomial $P$, with degree at most $d$, and total degree of $t$. We showed in class
that if you pick $r_1, \ldots, r_n$ uniformly and independently at random in a set $S$ then 
\[ \mathbf{Pr}[P(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n) = 0] \le \frac{nd}{|S|} \]
We now want to strengthen this result to:
\[ \mathbf{Pr}[P(r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n) = 0] \le \frac{t}{|S|} \]


\subsection*{Problem 7}
Show if $NP \subseteq BPP$, then $NP = RP$

\subsection*{Problem 8}
Define a $ZPP$-machine as a probabilistic Turing Machine that can output 3 things: accept, reject, and ?.
A $ZPP$-machine $M$ decided a langauge $A$ if for every $x \in L$ it accepts with probability at least $2/3$, and
rejects with probability 0, for $x \notin L$ it rejects with probability $2/3$ and accepts with probability 0, and it
outputs $?$ on any input with probability at most $1/3$.
