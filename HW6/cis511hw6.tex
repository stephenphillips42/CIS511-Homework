\subsection*{Problem 1}
Let $TQBF_{CNF} = \{ \phi \mid \phi \textrm{ is a TQBF with the part after the quantifiers being in CNF} \}$. We show
that $TQBF_{CNF}$ is PSPACE-Complete by reducing $TQBF$ to it in polynomial time.

% Didn't we show the equivalence of arbitrary boolean formulas and CNF boolean formulas in class? How to convert one
% To the other in polynomial time? Look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseitin_transformation

\subsection*{Problem 2}

% Wait... isn't this just a slightly more complicated version of PATH? Meaning we just need to know:
% If there is a path for both the cat and the mouse to the hole, and the cat's shortest path to the hole has length
% less than or equal to the mouses, then the cat wins.

\subsection*{Problem 3}
% Don't know how to do this one.

\subsection*{Problem 4}
\subsubsection{Part a}
% Is this not just enumerate all formulas less than this and check that they are equivalent by going through all 2^n
% formulas? 

\subsubsection{Part b}
% This doesn't work because it takes exponential time to verify that two formulas are the same.

\subsection*{Problem 5}
% Really don't know

\subsection*{Problem 6}
% Also don't know
