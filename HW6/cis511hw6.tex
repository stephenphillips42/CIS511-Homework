\subsection*{Problem 1}
Let $TQBF_{CNF} = \{ \phi \mid \phi \textrm{ is a TQBF with the part after the quantifiers being in CNF} \}$. We show
that $TQBF_{CNF}$ is PSPACE-Complete by reducing $TQBF$ to it in polynomial time.

% Didn't we show the equivalence of arbitrary boolean formulas and CNF boolean formulas in class? How to convert one
% To the other in polynomial time? Look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseitin_transformation

So we just need to show that any boolean formula can be converted to an equivalent CNF formula in polynomial time.
We showed something similar to this in class in our reduction from SAT to 3SAT. Here we show this again.

Consider the formula like logical a gate network (unable to show diagram), with the operators acting as two input
gates. We can attach intermediate variables to the wires of the gates to change the formula into CNF form. We
can consider the network to only have AND, OR and NOT gates without loss of generality. We now find the formulas
that convert the gates into an equivalent CNF form, with existance qualifiers:
\begin{itemize}
\item AND gate:
\begin{align*}
xy \;\iff&\; \exists z : (z \implies (xy))(\bar{z} \implies \overline{(xy)}) & \textrm{Equivalent definitions} \\
\iff &\; \exists z : (\bar{z} + (xy))(z + \bar{x} + \bar{y}) & \textrm{DeMorgan's law and Definition of Implication}\\
\iff &\; \exists z : (\bar{z} + x)(\bar{z} + y)(z + \bar{x} + \bar{y}) & \textrm{Distributive law} \\
\end{align*}
\item OR gate:
\begin{align*}
x + y \;\iff&\;\exists z:(z \implies(x + y))(\bar{z}\implies \overline{(x + y)})&\textrm{Equivalent definitions} \\
\iff &\; \exists z : (\bar{z} + x + y)(z + \bar{x}\bar{y}) & \textrm{DeMorgan's law and Definition of Implication} \\
\iff &\; \exists z : (\bar{z} + x + y)(z + \bar{x})(z + \bar{y}) & \textrm{Distributive law} \\
\end{align*}
\item NOT gate:
\begin{align*}
\bar{x} \;\iff&\;\exists z:(z \implies x)(\bar{z}\implies \bar{x}) & \textrm{Equivalent definitions} \\
\iff &\; \exists z : (\bar{z} + x)(z + \bar{x}) & \textrm{DeMorgan's law and Definition of Implication} \\
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
Thus for each gate we add in at most 3 more variables. If there are $n$ variables, and $m$ gates, this means the new
formula would be of size $O(m + n)$ still. You can also think of this in terms of the original formula instead of the
gates, There is a correspondence between gates and the $+$ or $\cdot$ operators, so it would still be the same factor
of three blowup.
% OK Not sure of this... I know it is still polynomial though.

\subsection*{Problem 2}
We are looking at the game of cat and mouse on a graph. The game is given an undirected graph $G$ and nodes $c$ and
$m$, the starting nodes for the cat and mouse respectively, and a special `hole' node $h$, the cat wants to get to
the same position as the mouse, and the mouse wants to get to the whole before that happens. The language is:

\begin{align*}
HAPPY-CAT =&\; \{ \langle G,c,m,h \rangle \mid \\
          &\;\;\; G,c,m,h \textrm{ form a game of cat and mouse and Cat has a winning strategy} \\
          &\;\;\;    \textrm{ if it moves first} \}
\end{align*}

% Wait... isn't this just a slightly more complicated version of PATH? Meaning we just need to know:
% If there is a path for both the cat and the mouse to the hole, and the cat's shortest path to the hole has length
% less than or equal to the mouses, then the cat wins.


\subsection*{Problem 3}
We are considering 
\[ MIN-FORMULA = \{ \phi \mid \phi \textrm{ has no equivalent formula smaller than it}\} \]
We want to show that if $P = NP$, then $MIN-FORMULA \in P$.
% Does this not imply that MIN-FORMULA is in NP? And that EQUIVALENCY is in NP (how is that possible?).
We will heavily rely on the assumption that $P = NP$. First it is easy to see that to check that two formulas are
not equivalent is in NP: $\overline{EQUIV} =
\{ \langle \phi, \psi \rangle \mid \phi \textrm{ is not equivalent to }\psi \}$. The verifier is the set of inputs
that makes the two functions differ. Since we assume $P = NP$, we know that its complement $EQUIV$ is in $P$ as well. 
That means there must be a deterministic Turing machine $D_{EQUIV}$ that decides $EQUIV$ in polynomial time.

It is also easy to see that with $D_{EQUIV}$ it is easy to decide
\[ \overline{MIN-FORMULA} = \{ \phi \mid \phi \textrm{ has an equivalent formula smaller than it}\} \]
the complement
of what we are looking for. The verifier is the formula that is equivalent and smaller. Note that this only works as
a verifier since we assume $D_{EQUIV}$ runs in polynomial time. And since has a verifier it is in $NP$ and by 
assumption in $P$. So there is a deterministic Turing Machine $M$ that decides $\overline{MIN-FORMULA}$, and hence
we can complement its output and get a deterministic Turing Machine that decides ${MIN-FORMULA}$


\subsection*{Problem 4}
We use the definition of $MIN-FORMULA$ from above.
\subsubsection{Part a}
We want to show that $MIN-FORMULA \in PSPACE$
% Is this not just enumerate all formulas less than this and check that they are equivalent by going through all 2^n
% formulas? 

\subsubsection{Part b}
We will show that the following argument is wrong: $MIN-FORMULA \in coNP$ since if $\phi \notin MIN-FORMULA$ then
$\phi$ has a smaller equivalent formula which a NTM can guess.
% This doesn't work because it takes exponential time to verify that two formulas are the same.

\subsection*{Problem 5}
Show that the language of properly nested parenthesis and brackets is in $L$ (e.g. $([()()]([]))$ )
% Really don't know

\subsection*{Problem 6}
Show that $UCYCLE = \{ \langle G \rangle \mid G \textrm{is an undirected graph with a simple cycle} \}$
is in $L$.
% Also don't know
